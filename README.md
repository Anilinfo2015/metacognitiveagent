# Meta Cognitive Agent

This project is inspired by DARPA CALO project to create standard open source framework and architecture to build and develop cognitive agent by using this state of art solution. After reading 1000's of research paper and studing 100's of open source and commercial application we realize their is no standard and state of framework availabe to start our own cognitive agent.
